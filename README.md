## Overview 

This repository provides Python scripts and a complete data analysis pipeline for 3D calcium imaging of thermosensory neurons in *Drosophila* larvae. Designed as an instructional resource, the pipeline offers step-by-step guidance to analyze real calcium imaging datasets with minimal coding experience.

### This pipeline is used to:

- Extract neuron fluorescence intensities from Z-stack TIFFs using TrackMate in Fiji/ImageJ.

- Performing background correction, and running quantitative analysis to calculate Î”F/Fmin across time.

- Align calcium activity with temperature profiles.

- Visualize average responses.

âœ… No prior programming experience is required

</p>

Dorsal organ warm cells (DOWCs) are thermosensory neurons located in the dorsal organ ganglion of *Drosophila* larvae. These neurons are activated by warming and mediate warm avaidance behavior. Using the *Ir68a-Gal4 > UAS-GCaMP6m* system, DOWCs can be specifically labeled and visualized through calcium imaging.

## Requirements and Preperation

To complete this analysis following softwares are required:

- **ImageJ (Fiji)**: (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/). For this project, download the JRE version. (JDK version is designed for developers e.g., writing plugins or scripting Fiji in Java), 
- **Python 3.6+**: (https://www.python.org/).

### Project Folder Setup

To ensure proper file organization and avoid path-related errors:

- Create a new folder on your computer (e.g. Desktop) named:
  `CI_project` (e.g. Desktop/CI_project)

- Inside this folder, you will:
  
  - Save and the **demo datasets**
    
  - Create your **Python virtual environment**
    
  - Clone or download the **GitHub repository** to **Python virtual environment**

(This is an example of what `CI_project` folder look like after extracting demo data and save the repository)

- DOWC_demo file structure

Before starting the analysis, unzip <DOWC_demo> and make sure the files and folder structure match the following:

<pre> ```
project/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ MAX_Samplexxx.tif            # Maximum projection TIFF for initial visualization
â”œâ”€â”€ Analog - <timestamp>.csv      # Temperature log recorded during imaging
â”œâ”€â”€ Samplexxx_stacks/           # 21 z-slice TIFFs (Z01 to Z21), each with 88 time points
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Z01.tif
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Analysis/       # empty folder with correct file structure 
     â”œâ”€â”€ background_i.xlsx       
     â”œâ”€â”€ Neuron 0/   
     â””â”€â”€ Neuron 1/    
``` </pre>

Notes: Keep file names and folder structure exactly as recommended. The analysis scripts rely on this structure to locate and process data correctly. Incorrect naming or layout will likely result in file-not-found or parsing errors during execution.             

## Workflow

### Step1: Visualizing Neuron Response in ImageJ

- Start the analysis by visualizing the `maximum projection image` in Fiji (ImageJ). This image helps you quickly access:

  - overall fluorescence intensity
  
  - neuron number, shape, and locations
  
  - movement artifacts 

Notes: Adding annotations and screenshots is strongly recommended. It helps track neuron position for later individual z-slice analysis.<br>
![DOWC_demo](git_images/image_13.png)

Notes: Large movement prevents TrackMate tracking, and manual extraction of intensity values will be necessary.

- Loading the Image in Fiji
  
  - Launch Fiji (ImageJ)
    
  - Drag and drop `MAX_DOWC001.tif` into the Fiji window, or use `File â†’ Open`... and select `MAX_DOWC001.tif`.
    
  - Use the slider at the bottom to scroll through time frames.
    
  - Adjust brightness Use `Brightness/Contrast` or `Ctrl + Shift + C` on windows `Command + Shift + C` on macOS.<br>

<p align="">
  <img src="git_images/image_14.png" alt="" width="600"/>
</p>

## Step 2: Extracting Fluorescence Intensity Using TrackMate

This step use TrackMate in Fiji to extract fluorescence intensity over time for each neuron from selected z-stack TIFFs. We will use Neuron 0 as example to demonstrate z-stack analysis. 

### 1. Start with the brightest z-stack in Fiji

- Go to â€˜SampleXXX_stack/â€™ (e.g. DOWC_demp/DOWC001_stack) folder and open a mid-plane TIFF (e.g. DOWC_demp/DOWC001_stack/DOWC_Z10.tif)

- Adjust brightness/contrast to see cells clear.

- Find a strong response time point (e.g. t=42 in demo sample)

- Open neighboring z-stacks at t=42 and compare fluorescence brightness.

- Select the strongest slice to start the analysis

  - For example:
    
    - Neuron 0, start the analysis on ##_z08.tif
      
    - Neuron 1, start the analysis on ##_z10.tiff<br>

<p align="">
  <img src="git_images/image_15.png" alt="" width="700"/>
</p>

### 2. Lauch TrackMate for Neuron 0

- Open DOWC001_Z08.tif in Fiji

- Go to Plugin/Tracking/TrackMate.

- When prompted with `Z/T swapped?`, click `Yes`.<br>

![](git_images/image_16.png)<br>

![](git_images/image_17.png)<br>

### 3. Configure Detection Settings in TrackMate

- Detector: Select `DoG (Difference of Gaussian)`<br>
![](git_images/image_18.png)<br>

- Estimated object diameter: 22â€“36 pixels (based on neuron size)

- Quality threshold: Start with 1.0 (reduce if needed)

- Enable:
  
  - Sub-pixel localization
    
  - Pre-process with median filter

- Click Preview to confirm that the detection (purple circle) fits the neuron correctly.<br>

![](git_images/image_19.png)<br>

### 4. Apply Spot Filters

- Use `Set filters on spots` to remove irrelevant signals

- Filter by `X/Y position` to isolate Neuron 0.

- Use `Preview` to ensure only the correct neuron is selected.<br>

- After setting the filters, carefully inspect the purple tracking circles across all time points.
  
  - Make sure the full response is captured, from the start of fluorescence increase to the return to baseline.
    
  - No timepoints should be missing once the response begins.
    
  - If any frames are skipped or the tracking is incomplete, adjust the filters until continuous tracking is achieved.

![](git_images/image_20.png)<br>

- Select `Simple LAP tracker` with following settings.<br>

![](git_images/image_21.png)<br>

![](git_images/image_22.png)<br>

### 5. Export Intensity Data

- Click `Sports` to acquire `All spots table` <br>

![](git_images/image_23.png)<br>

- Sort `All spots data` by clicking `Track ID` <br>

![](git_images/image_24.png)<br>

- Click `Export to CSV` to save the file into `Analysis/Neuron 0/Mean_Intensity08.csv`.

### 6. Clean the Exported CSV file

Notes: Accurate cleaning at this stage is essential for proper Î”F/Fmin calculation and downstream analysis in Python.

- Open the Mean_Intensity08.csv, remove extra headers

- Manually check each row. Use `Track ID` and visualize same ID image in `All sport table` in Trackmate. Remove any incorrect or off-target tracks in csv file. 

- Sort the file by `POSITION_T`. 

- Delete duplicates. 

- Save the cleaned csv.

## Step 3: Background Correction

Before calculating Î”F/Fmin, five background fluorescence data must be recorded for each Z-stack used in analysis.

### 1. Open `background_i.xlsx` located in `Analysis/` folder.<br>

![](git_images/image_25.png)<br> 

### 2. Measure Background Fluorescence in Fiji

- Go to t=12,24,36,48,60.

- Hold shift and press the Oval tool in Fiji

- Draw â€˜circular ROIâ€™ on a background area close to target neuron using the same diameter as neuron cell. 

- Press M to obtain the intensity value

- Record five background values at t=12,24,36,48,60 into the corresponding column of `background_i.xlsx`.<br>

![](git_images/image_26.png)<br> 

- Copy and paste to background_i.xlsx.<br>

![](git_images/image_27.png)<br> 


Notes: The number of background values recorded must exactly match the number of Mean_Intensity##.csv files for each neuron.<br>
For example, if Neuron 0 has cleaned data from Z05 to Z11, there should be seven sets of five background values for Neuron 0 in background_i.xlsx.

## Step 5: Work on Additional z-stacks
Repeat the analysis from step 2-4 on all other z-stacks.

## Step 6: Checklist Before Running Python

Make sure the following are true before running the analysis script:

- All extra headers are removed from every Mean_Intensity##.csv file

- No duplicate POSITION_T values exist in any Mean_Intensity##.csv

- background_i.xlsx contains a matching number of rows for each neuron's Z-slice .csv files

- Inconsistencies here will result in Python script errors or inaccurate Î”F/Fmin values.

## Step 7: Calculate Î”F/Fmin

Once all intensity files and background data are prepared and validated, use the Python script 'CIAanalysis_120s.py' to compute 'Î”F/Fmin' for each neuron and generate visual outputs.

### 1. Open terminal or Pycharm

Navigate to the project directory and activate your Python environment (if applicable).

### 2. Command

Run the following command from terminal or within PyCharm terminal:

```bash
python CIAnalysis_120s.py -i path/to/Analysis --merge --cell_type DOWC
```
- Script arguments

  - -i: path to the Analysis/ folder

  - --merge: (optional) Combines results from all neurons into a summary

  - --cell_type: adds a label (e.g., DOWC, DOCC) to outputs for reference

### 3. Input files before running CIAanalysis_120s.py

<pre> ```
project/
â””â”€â”€ Analysis/        # CIAanalysis_120s.py input
    â”œâ”€â”€ background_i.xlsx       
    â”œâ”€â”€ Neuron 0/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Mean_Intensity##.csv      # file name should following the naming 
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ Neuron 1/
        â”œâ”€â”€ Mean_Intensity##.csv      # file name should following the naming 
        â””â”€â”€ ...
``` </pre>  

### 4. Output files after running CIAanalysis_120s.py

After the script finishes, you will find the results in the following structure:

<pre> ```
project/
â””â”€â”€ Analysis/        #  CIAanalysis_120min.py input 
    â”œâ”€â”€ background_i.xlsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ background_list.csv             
    â”œâ”€â”€ Neuron 0/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Mean_Intensity##.csv      # file name should following the naming 
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ Neuron 1/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Mean_Intensity##.csv      # file name should following the naming 
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ results/       # generated results folder
        â”œâ”€â”€Neuron 0.csv       # Î”F/Fmin trace for Neuron 0
        â”œâ”€â”€Neuron 1.csv
        â”œâ”€â”€Neuron Plots/
        â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€Neuron 0.png       # plot for neuron 0
        â”‚  â””â”€â”€Neuron 1.png
        â””â”€â”€Merged_data/
           â”œâ”€â”€merged_data.csv       # Combined Î”F/Fmin data
           â””â”€â”€Average_dF.png
  
``` </pre>

## Step 8: Run `CITbind_dynamic.py`

This step integrate the calcium activity (Î”F/Fmin) with the temperature log file collected during imaging. <br>
It generates a dual-axis plot that visualizes neuronal responses alongside temperature fluctuations over time.<br>

### 1. Input files before running the command

Create a new folder named SampleXXX_date (e.g. DOWC001_20240820) 

Copy and paste in merged_data.csv from Analysis/results/merged_data.csv and temperature log

<pre> ```
project/ 
â””â”€â”€SampleXXX_date/        #  
    â”œâ”€â”€ merged_data.csv
    â””â”€â”€ Analog - <timestamp>.csv
``` </pre>
      
### 2. Command 

Run the following command in your terminal or PyCharm:

```bash
python CITbind_dynamic.py -i path/to/SampleXXX_date -n
```

- Arguments

  - -i: Path to the folder that contains:

    - merged_data.csv

    - the corresponding temperature log file (e.g., Analog - 8-20-2024.csv)

  - -n: Number of neurons analyzed (i.e., number of individual neuron .csv files)

### 3. Output files after running the command

- The script will generate:

  - Overlaid plot of Î”F/Fmin and temperature vs. time

  - CSV file combining temperature and calcium signal data

<pre> ```
â””â”€â”€SampleXXX_date/          
    â”œâ”€â”€ SampleXXX_date.csv
    â”œâ”€â”€ SampleXXX_date_cbind.csv
    â”œâ”€â”€ SampleXXX_date_temp.csv
    â”œâ”€â”€ SampleXXX_date_cbind0.pdf
    â””â”€â”€ SampleXXX_date_cbind1.pdf
``` </pre>

After run the script you will get the results for the current sample. Then continue to work on all other samples and sumarize all the results into csv files. <br>

## Step 9: Average Calcium Signals Across Samples Using df_temp_class.py

This step computes the average Î”F/Fmin trace and generates group-level plots across multiple samples or neurons. This is useful for comparing replicates or summarizing class-wide data.

### 1. Required input files

- Create a new folder named â€˜summaryâ€™
  
- Copy two files to 'summary' folder:
  
  - Summary_df.csv â€” calcium traces from all neurons
    
  - Summary_temperature.csv â€” corresponding temperature data for each sample

- Make sure:
  
  - 'Summary_df.csv': the first column name is Temperature, then continue with n1, n2, ...
    
  - 'Summary_temperature.csv': the first column name is Temperature, then continue with t1, t2, ... 

### 2. Command
Run the following command in your terminal or PyCharm:

```bash
python df_temp_class.py path/summary_df.csv path/summary_temperature.csv
```

### 3. Output

- The script will generate:

  - Summary plot of the group average Î”F/Fmin trace with SEM (error bars)

  - Average trace CSV summarizing Î”F/Fmin values across all neurons
